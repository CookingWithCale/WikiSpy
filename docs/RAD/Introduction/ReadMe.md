## Introduction

WikiSpy is a tool for monitoring Wikipedia for tampering by hostile actors and political bias. WikiSpy is a tool that uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms along with a Website to facilitate crowd-sourcing in order to train neural networks using hand-curated ML training datasets to teach computers to spot Wikipedia contributions from the CCP, Russian, and other hostile and politically biased actors foreign and domestic. WikiSpy is most easily described an AI version of the fact-checking site Snopes mixed with the news source factual authority service and browser plugin called NewsGuard. WikiSpy will be able to tell you exactly what political biases a Wikipedia contributor has based upon their contributions and other data gathered from the Clear and Dark web.

The most hostile actor is bar none the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which we shall prove is actually a Fascist Structure that most resembles Nazism. The CCP has been murdering and brutalizing the Chinese People for decades, and they have their own version of Wikipedia that paints the CCP as all that is good and the Western World, and in particular America, is all that is bad. The CCP has been sending out armies of foreign exchange students, who are children of CCP officials, to learn as much from the Outside world and to tamper with Wikipedia and other knowledge bases in order to rewrite our history slowly over time by changing out facts and putting the enemies of the CCP into the far-right politics category in order to cause enemies of the Far-right to attack, diminish, and destroy the CCP's enemies.
