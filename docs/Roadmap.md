## Project Roadmap

### Status Update

The current code was writing for an IoT control software and is getting a Flask and React.JS website GUI, simply because the Python shared server is dramatically cheaper. It's easiest to describe as a CAD-like tree structure with Max MSP style bangs, which are kind of like neural networks firing. Everything is A=A*B. It's like a one-button mouse embedded scripting language that allows you to feed in junk data and it will do no harm, and if you configure the graph right you can make dirty simple setup and utility scripts, expose IoT endpoints, etc. I have another open-source organization with a bunch of C++ code I'm using to fit Wikipedia in RAM called the Interactive Gym Environment and Education Kit (iGeek) WikiWorld, which has no code right now, based on my [Script2](https://github.com/KabukiStarship/Script2) and [Kabuki Toolkit](https://github.com/KabukiStarship/KabukiToolkit) Embedded C++ libraries I need help with ASAP. These libraries are built on a set of contiguous memory data structures that we're going to use to translate digital neurons to memory addresses and interface MXNet with Wikipedia. Basically we're replacing all of the words in the english language and Wikipedia with indexes in a contiguous memory dictionary accessible by multiple threads via interprocess pipes. This will allow us to fit as much of Wikipedia into RAM as possible.

### Phase 1: Document software requirements and design

#### Milestone 1: Completed Requirements Analysis Document

#### Milestone 2: Completed Software System Document

#### Milestone 3: Received feedback and iterated design

#### Milestone 4: Implement requirements and software design

[The Ultimate Flask Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-flask-course/learn/lecture/14478802?start=0#overview) is a Udemy class that costs money, but you can always find a coupon online if you look for $12. It has a food, Q&A, Twitter clone, online store, chat forum, and weather apps and covers the standard Flask libraries.

### Phase 2: Created Political bias detector

#### Milestone 1: Built web interface to iterate through Wiki contributions and profile and rate political bias

#### Milestone 2: Built Political bias detector based on prior Wiki contributions and Wiki profile

#### Milestone 3: Improved Political bias detector with additional criteria

### Phase 3:
