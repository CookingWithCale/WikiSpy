## Premise

There is pervasive tempering, misinformation, political bias, and criminal activity in the form of cyber war from hostile State and criminal actors such as cartel human smuggling networks. In this paper will will explore the methods that WikiSpy uses to tempering, misinformation, political bias, and criminal activity using AI and a social network and social networking website.

### Political Bias Detection

Political bias in Wiki contributors can be detected using a tool that rates Wiki article contributions based on political bias, and a deep learning neural network can easily spot the bias. Traditional methods have used Long short-term memory networks (LSTM), but these methods have been supplanted by more modern methods like biologically inspired neral networks. New methods also use twin algorithms where one twin will use a fuzzer to fuzz the neural network parameters with random noise to improve accuracy.

### Crow-sourcing

To have proof of tempering, misinformation, political bias, and criminal activity is one thing, it's another to get the Wiki to read the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

## Conclusion

We have not made any conclusions so far.
