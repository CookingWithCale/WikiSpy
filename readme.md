# WikiSpy

A tool to monitor Wikipedia for tampering, misinformation, political bias, and criminal activity. The Vision of WikiSpy is to make Wikipedia non-biased and factually correct. The project status is pre-alpha and non-functional. WikiSpy is easiest described as a mix of Snopes and NewsGuard that tells you if a Wikipedia article is biased or factually incorrect and who tampered with the article what, when, where, and why. The best place to start is to read the Quickstart guide.

## #OneGigWikiChallenge

The #OneGigWikiChallenge is a #TensorFlow challenge to fit all of Wikipedia on a modern consumer-grade laptop into one gigabyte of contiguous d-cache RAM including images and excluding CPU instructions and multi-threaded stack RAM; GPUs and TPUs are allowed but you must generate the RAM data from the 1GB of contiguous data and CPU instructions. You may use any GPUs, TPUs, etc needed to find your solution, but the end result is required to run repeatably on a modern consumer-grade laptop, which is defined as being ***at most*** similar in performance to a quad-core Intel i5 with 8GB RAM and a 3GB GeForce 1060. As of 28 June 2020, there are 6,110,947 articles in the English Wikipedia containing over 3.6 billion words with with about 32 gigabytes of images, so have fun.
