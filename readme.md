# WikiSpy

A tool to monitor Wikipedia for tampering, misinformation, political bias, and criminal activity. The Vision of WikiSpy is to make Wikipedia non-biased and factually correct. The project status is pre-alpha and non-functional. WikiSpy is easiest described as a mix of Snopes and NewsGuard that tells you if a Wikipedia article is biased or factually incorrect and who tampered with the article what, when, where, and why. The best place to start is to read the Quickstart guide.

## #AllRamWikiChallenge
