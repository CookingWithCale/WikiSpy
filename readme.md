# WikiSpy

WikiSpy is a tool to monitor Wikis for tampering, misinformation, political bias, and criminal activity. The Vision of WikiSpy is to make Wikipedia non-biased and factually correct without any propaganda. The mission is to create an AI tool and social network of crowd-sourced fact-checkers and content creators to gather enough Wiki contributors to override misinformation, tampering, political bias, and criminal activity on Wikipedia. WikiSpy is easiest described as a mix of Snopes and NewsGuard that tells you if a Wikipedia article is biased or factually incorrect and who tampered with the article what, when, where, and why.

The way the software will work is that there are bad actors who control Wikipedia, some are corporations that control PR, State actors like FBI, CIA, Chinese 'Communist'/Nazi Party, Chinese Military, Russian hackers, leftist, neo-nazis, and a host of biased and crazy people. The admin of Wikipedia has a Leftist pro-communist pro-Antifa pro-BLM anti-white bias and the current powers that control Wikipedia can outvote the truth to create a propaganda network that creates a substantial cyber war threat. To counter this we need to be able to create an AI-generated reverse psychological profile of Wiki contributors and admin, and create a social network of people that get get the word out and get enough Wiki authors to contribute to override the tempering, misinformation, political bias, and criminal activity on Wikipedia.

We're creating an open-source WikiSpy tool with closed-source website for security purposes.
